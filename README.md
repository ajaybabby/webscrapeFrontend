# Frontend - Product Data Explorer (scaffold)

This is a minimal Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Query scaffold created by ChatGPT.

Quick dev commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If your backend API sits on a different origin in development, set up rewrites in `next.config.js` or use an env variable and update fetch calls.
